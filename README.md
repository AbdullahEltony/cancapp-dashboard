## API Endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CORS Errors**
   - Ensure the backend allows requests from `http://localhost:5173`
   - Check if the API base URL is correct

2. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify admin credentials
   - Check if the JWT token is being sent correctly
   - Clear browser storage if needed

3. **Build Errors**
   - Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
   - Run `npm install` again
   - Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`

4. **Port Already in Use**
   - The app will automatically suggest using a different port
   - Or manually kill the process using the port

### Performance Tips

- The app uses React Query for efficient data caching
- Images are lazy-loaded for better performance
- Charts are responsive and optimized
- Components are optimized with React.memo where appropriate
